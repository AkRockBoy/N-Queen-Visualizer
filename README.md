1. Introduction

  The N-Queen Visualizer with Backtracking is a software project aimed at visualizing the backtracking algorithm for solving the N-Queen problem. The project will        allow users to input the number of queens they want to place on an N x N chessboard, and the program will find a solution to the problem if one exists.

2. Functional Requirements

  The software should have the following features:
  2.1. User Interface:
  
    The software should have a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Pygame library. The GUI should have the following components:
    . A text box for the user to input the value of N.
    . A "Start" button to start the algorithm and display the first step of the visualization.
    . A "Next" button to step through the algorithm one move at a time.
    . A "Reset" button to clear the board and allow the user to enter a new value of N.
    
  2.2. N-Queen Algorithm:
  
    The software should implement the N-Queen algorithm using recursion and backtracking. The algorithm should find all possible solutions to the problem, but the 
    program will visualize only one solution.

  2.3. Visualization:
    The software should have a chessboard on which the queens will be placed. The chessboard should be displayed as an N x N grid, where N is the value input by the 
    user. The chessboard should be initialized with no queens on it.
    . When the user clicks the "Start" button, the program should show the first step of the visualization.
    . Each time the user clicks the "Next" button, the program should display the next step of the visualization.
    . The visualization should show the positions of the queens on the chessboard as they are being placed. Each time a queen is placed, the program should highlight the row, column, and diagonal on which the queen is placed.
    . If no solution exists for the given value of N, the program should display an error message.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
  3.1. Performance:
  
  The program should be able to solve the problem and visualize the solution for small values of N (up to 15) in a reasonable time (a few seconds).
  
  3.2. Reliability:

    The program should be reliable and should not crash or display any errors during execution.
  
  3.3. User Interface:

    The GUI should be intuitive and user-friendly.
  
  3.4. Portability:

    The program should be easily portable and should be able to run on any computer that has Python and Pygame installed.

4. Constraints

  4.1. Hardware:
  
    The software requires a computer with enough processing power and memory to run Python and Pygame.
    
  4.2. Input Constraints:
  
  The software will accept only positive integers as input.
  
  4.3. Performance Constraints:
  
    For large values of N (greater than 15), the program may take a long time to find a solution and visualize it.

5. Future Enhancements

  . Adding an option to display all solutions for a given value of N.
  . Adding an option to change the color of the chessboard and the queens.
  . Adding an option to save the visualization as an image file.
  
6. Conclusion

The N-Queen Visualizer with Backtracking is a software project aimed at visualizing the backtracking algorithm for solving the N-Queen problem. The software will 
have a GUI built using the Pygame library and will implement the N-Queen algorithm using recursion and backtracking. The visualization will show the positions of 
the queens on the chessboard as they are being placed. The program will find all possible solutions to the problem, but the visualization will show only one solution.
The program will be reliable, user-friendly.
